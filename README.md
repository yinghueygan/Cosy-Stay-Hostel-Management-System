Hostel Management System is developed with C++. This system is mainly developed for college hostel and its primary user is the hostel administrator. Through this system, hostel administrator is able to manage the records of students who stay in the hostel and this includes add, edit, delete, display, search and sort. The information of tenant that is added, edited or deleted will all be recorded in a text file and can be retrieved when needed. For instance, information such as tenantâ€™s name, phone number, room allocated and so on will be retrieved when the search and sort actions are performed. Besides, a tenant can view hostel details such as room floor plan and rental fee list.
